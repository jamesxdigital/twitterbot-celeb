This is my first attempt of making a Twitterbot.

[@yo_inquisitor](https://twitter.com/yo_inquisitor)will tweet every 1-2 hours. He'll either tweet a random celebrity a random question; tweet a random active user a random question; or tweet a random thought or quote with a trending hashtag (these can sometimes prove to be controversial).

This Node.js application runs constantly from an online Heroku server. It's been running since May 2017 and the twitter account has picked up a few followers along the way...
